                  <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p> The mismanagement consists of: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> FIXED organizers (currently Marylou GM and Johan): cash management, admin, website‚Ä¶) </li> 
                            <li> 1 or 2 occasional organizers (s) ("event organizers"): they are in place for the duration of 1 HESH event. </li> 
                        </ul>   
                        <h2> The fixed organizers : </h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>guard the principles and traditions (objective, event program)</li>
                            <li>provide support for the occasional organizers (experience sharing)</li>
                            <li>provide facilities (communication, newsletters, website, budget management, provide bank account)</li>
                            <li>ensure continuity: next editions are defined</li>
                            <li>decide what will happen with the money we saved</li>
                            <li>handle registrations and ensure everyone is paying </li>
                            <li>etc	</li>	
                        </ul>

                        <h2>The occasional organizers: </h2>
                        <p> They are typically locals, meaning: they live nearby the place where the next event will take place.  For instance, for the 2023 edition in Lyon: it was Charles who lives in Lyon, and elaborated the whole event together with his local team Anne-Christine and Simon (who also live nearby Lyon).  They do the entire practical organization of a particular HESH edition: </p>	
                        <ul> 
                             <li>identify accommodation, negotiate with hotels, restaurants... 
                             <li>propose program </li>
                             <li>define the running trails </li>
                             <li>find and book the restaurants where we will have diner</li>
                             <li>etc </li>

                  <summary class="faq-question">Our finances, your money?</summary>
                  <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p> Our intention is to have NO profit.  All the money that members pay for events, returns to the members themselves. 
                    The fixed management (Marylou, Johan) and organizing committee of a particular edition have not any material or financial interest in doing this. They are doing this gladly and 100 % on voluntary basis, for free.</p>

                    <p>  We are a 100 % non-profit organization.  However, we DO have some savings. Currently, we have accumulated 3084 euro from the 5 previous editions.  This amount originates from: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>healthy budget management (if you don't make profit, you probably make loss) </li>
                        <li>from certain participants who signed up but finally couldn‚Äôt participate.  In such situation, in line with our charter, these members become involuntary sponsors. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p> These savings will - in hte end - alwasy return <em> entirely </em>to all members. </p>

                    <p> They are used for: </p> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Funding the preparation of the next edition (e.g., paying the advance deposit to the hotel)</li>
                        <li>Sponsoring partially the hotel/rego fees: members will pay less than the actual cost.</li>
                        <li>Maintaining a minimum buffer for unexpected events/expenses.</li>
                      </ul>

                  <summary class="faq-question">What does HESH membership cost?</summary>
                  <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p> Your membership costs‚Ä¶ nothing!  We only expect that, as often as possible, you will participate at the events.  As participant of an event, you simply have to pay a registration fee.  We want to keep events affordable for everyone. </p>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> The rego fee (covering all costs apart from accommodation) will typically be around 200 Euro.  </li>
                        <li> The hotel accommodation usually costs around 50 Euro / person/night on double room basis.</li>
                        <li> The travel expenses to reach the venue come on top of this, and are obviously different for everyone.</li>

                  <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p> As a member, you get access to several communication channels.  They support the daily contacts and coordination before, during the events.  But also, after the events, they are a means to remain connected.  For instance they are used to virtually celebrate someone‚Äôs birthday, or share other updates. </p>
                    <p> WhatsApp group and the Facebook group are managed by the mis-management team, and only accessible for approved HESH members.   We have a strict policy of only sharing pictures within these channels.

                  <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The choice of a next edition typically happens through a kind of voting at the end of a HESH event.  </p> 
                    <p> Candidate-organizers present and promote in front of all participants their proposal (the proposed location, the proposed organization team etc) and all present participants can bring out 1 (secret) vote. The proposal which gets the most votes, wins the election, and gets the honour to organize the next edition. 	 </p>

                    <p>The acronym ‚ÄúHESH‚Äù stands for ‚ÄúHyderabadi European Small Hash‚Äù
                    We adopted ‚Äì pure coincidentally of course üòä ‚Äì a name for our club with some resemblance to ‚ÄúHASH‚Äù though both further have nothing to do with each other.  We are certainly not a HASH group or event, there are only certain similarities but also many differences. You could consider us as a small spin-off of the HASH movement.  </p>
