            <h1> What we do? </h1>

            <div >
                <p> We had 5 formal HESH weekend events since 2016.  It happens every 18 months, in May or in September. 
                Apart from this, many of us meet each other in between during our (professional or private) travels, and maintain casual contacts via social media. </p>
            </div>

            <h1> The concept </h1>

            <div id="our-events"> 
                <p> They span a long weekend, somewhere in Europe.  We stay together in a small-scale cozy family hotel.  We do a lot of activities together:  there are 2 or 3 walks/runs, we explore nature and culture of the location, we have fun, we have good (local) food, there is time for relaxing and catching up with people you really like, we party, we talk sense and nonsense, at times: we drink a little bit (too much). </p>

                <p> The official event starts from early afternoon on Friday and ends after lunch on Sunday.   Many people already arrive a day earlier or stay back a few days longer, to utilize the opportunity to explore the city and its surroundings. </p>

                <p> <strong> The typical ingredients of an event </strong> </p>

                <ul> 

                    <li> We start with a <strong>welcome drink </strong> on Friday.  </li>
                    <li> We have 2 excellent <strong> walks/runs </strong>on Friday and Saturday, which form the backbone of the event.  <img src="img/our-events1.jpg" height="840" width="1824" alt="run picture"> Participants can opt for running or walking (so the group splits into 2 subgroups).                  
                    Both runs/walks are different.  Usually there is 1 city run along the touristic highlights of the city… but we also discover hidden pearls you don’t find in touristic guides. The second run/walk usually is in the country side.  Runs are around 10-12 km are walks are around 2 hours of walk. They are followed by a "hash-circle".       </li>	 
                    <li>We <strong> eat together</strong>, from Friday dinner till Sunday lunch time, with an accent on local specialities.                </li>
                    <li>There are <strong>surprise activities</strong>.  We had a flamenco evening, beer bike trip through the city, boat trips, young bull fighting, Indian-dressed evening, wine tasting… </li>
                    <li>A fixed ingredient also is an <strong> evening party </strong>(could be a pub crawl or a  cocktail party).  We stay hashers after all: a drinking club with running problems :-) </li>
                    <li>   <img id="our-events-pic2" src="img/our-events2.jpg" height="899" width="1599" alt="gathering picture"> There is a <strong> goody bag </strong>, which contains funny gadgets, but certainly always 1 or 2 nice, quality T-shirts that we wear during the run, and which participants also proudly wear on other occasions outside HESH. We care a lot that participants have a good “value for money" feeling.   </li>

                </ul>
