                <h1> What's in it for you? </h1>
                
                <ul>
                    <li> It gives you access to a unique <strong> network of friends </strong>strong> , distributed all over the world (mainly Europe, US, India).</li>
                    <li> It keeps yourself open-minded for <strong> other cultures </strong>strong>  and stances. </li>
                    <li>   It provides special<strong> opportunities while travelling </strong>: you can meet friends in their own country and in that way, you’re getting much more out of your journey than an “ordinary tourist” ever could. You can exchange professional experiences with people who work in an international context. </li>
                 </ul>

                <h1> How to become member?  </h1> 
                
                <ul> 
                    <li> It's easy:<strong> just contact us! </strong>. 
                
                         Simply clarify: what brings you to us?  Which members do you already know?  What is your association with India, Hyderabad, Europe, Hash.  Is it really your intention to become an active and permanent member and not a one time “visitor of one particular event”? </li>
                   <li>  Someone of the HESH management team will contact you soon and confirm your membership. </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>  From then onwards, you're welcome to participate in our events. You'll get access to our facebook group, whatsapp group etc</p>
                
                <h1> Our membership policy </h1>
                <p>  HESH is a <strong> CLOSED group </strong> of friends.  It means: you must be accepted as new member.   You might wrongly think that we are just another HASH event (like there are so many across the world) where everyone who wants it, can participate.  </p>

                <p> We want to keep the group limited in size, say up to max 30 active like-minded souls.   Because, first of all, we want to keep it cozy and guard that “everyone knows everyone”.  This is obviously a minimum requirement to consider each other as friends. </p>

                <p> Moreover, too many members would make the organization of our regular events a headache for the organizers.  Imagine for instance trying to find a place to have diner together, if you would be a group of 30 people.  A cumbersome organization would be the beginning of the end: nobody would any longer volunteer to organize the next edition!  </p>
