                <h2> India </h2>
                <p> Hesh members have lived and worked many years in India.  Some of them still do.  Several of them are even Indians.   
                They have lots of positive memories of that episode in their life, which they cherish.  They love and appreciate a lot this unique country, its people, its culture, its food etc .  For many of them, this India tenure influenced significantly the further flow of their life.  </p>
        
                 <p> Most of the Hesh members lived, more precisely, in <strong>Hyderabad</strong>.  This is a vibrant city in the South of India.  They carry this city in their hearts. </p> 
                
                 <p> You might have noticed: the word "HESH" in our logo is written in the Samarkan font, wich evokes the Hindi script.</p>

                 <p> I don't have to tell you that our logo refers to the European flag. </p>

               <h2>HASH </h2>

                 <p> Members of HESH are or were active HASHERS in India/Hyderabad and that’s also where the initial HESH members all became good friends.  </p>

                <p>HASH has many meanings, but don’t worry, here we are talking about a social movement "Hash House Harriers".  It is practised all over the world.  In a town where HASH exists, regular (e.g. weekly) gatherings are organized, following a certain fixed sequence of activities.   Wikipedia explains well what it is all about.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_House_Harriers">Hash House Harriers - Wikipedia </a> </p>
                
                <p> As a HESH member, we know the concept of Hashing and appreciate its somehow peculiar dynamics, because it is this formula that is imitated during our regular HESH-events, and the same kind of camaraderie is prevailing.   We inherited from HASH that we like to have fun, we don’t take ourselves too seriously, we embrace differences, we like to run or walk, and we don’t say no to a good beer.  
                
                </p>
                <p>Notice the 12 stars (of the european flag) in our logo have been replaced by running beer mugs. A wink towards HASH: Hashers are often called "drinking people with a running problem".  Each hash event has a run, followed bu drinking some beers. But many members are better in the latter than in ther first &#128513; </p>

                <h2>Friendship </h2>

                 <p> Though we often live 1000’s of kilometres away from each other, we are actively investing in our friendship.  We are convinced that friendship is like a plant: unless you give it water and fertilizer regularly, it will slowly perish. </p>

                <p>  What is the investment we do (and expect from members) in order to maintain our friendship?  </p>
               <ol>
                   <li>  We enthusiastically attend the official HESH events 
                    Every 1-2 year, we have a 3 days “official event” somewhere in Europe.  Then, we all meet and spend a nice time during a variety of activities.   It’s a unique opportunity to discover new places, guided by local friends! </li>

                     <li>  Once in a lifetime, each member (mostly 2 or 3 members work together) organizes this event in his/her own town or vicinity. </li>
                </ol>

                <p> HESH was founded in 2015 in Kodaikanal (South India) by Marylou Zuzarte (Germany) and Johan Vancanneyt (Belgium).   Close friendships had developed in India (specifically in Hyderabad) during 2007-12s.   But gradually, people got dispersed all over the world: some went back to their home country, others got professional assignments in other countries etc. </p>
                <p> Many people sensed a general desire to do something in order to maintain the friendship.  So finally, Marylou and Johan took the initiative to do something.  HESH was born, with a first edition in Berlin, and the rest is history!  
                Gradually, also new members have joined the club.  </p>
